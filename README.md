# Autoencoder
Autoencoder is an unsupervised artificial neural network that learns how to efficiently compress and encode data then learns how to reconstruct the data back from the reduced encoded representation to a representation that is as close to the original input as possible.

In this repository, two autoenocders are implemented using Tensorflow Deep Learning Framework on MNIST dataset
1. Simple Convolutional Autoencoder (convolutional_autoencoder.py)
2. Image denoising using autoencoder (image_denoising.py)
